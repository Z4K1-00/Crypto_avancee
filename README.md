In this project we created a program using the "Information Set Decoding" algorithm which is an algorithm that consists in finding k columns of the generator matrix G (k × n) hoping that they are error-free (to verify this the matrix M (k × k) constructed with these k columns can be invertible), which allows us to find the original message X (1 × k) by multiplying the elements of the vector Y (1 × n) without error with the matrix M. Then we can calculate the error in this way: E = Y⊕X×G, and if the error E (1× n) found is of weight t then we have decoded correctly.
